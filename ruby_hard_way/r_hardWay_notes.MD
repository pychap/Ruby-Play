## Notes for Ruby the hard way

#### **When should I use ** `puts` instead of `return` **in a function?**

The `return` from a function gives the line of code that called the function a result. You can think of a function as taking input through its arguments, and returning output through `return`. The `puts` is *completely* unrelated to this, and only deals with printing output to the terminal.

### The Truth Terms
* `&&` (and)
* `||` (or)
* `!`  (not)
* `!=` (not equal)
* `==` (equal)
* `===` (equal looser)
* `>=` (greater than equal)
* `<=` (less than equal)
* `true`
* `false`
